# 🧠 NeuroVision: Transforming Thoughts into Visuals

> A deep learning-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) project that translates human thoughts into visual representations using EEG signals.

## 📌 Overview

**NeuroVision** is a novel system developed to interpret real-time brain activity and translate it into images. It leverages **EEG signals** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to classify and visualize thoughts such as digits or objects—opening up new possibilities in **assistive technology**, **neuroscience**, and **mental health diagnostics**.

This project was sponsored by **Amnex Infotechnologies Pvt. Ltd.** and carried out under the guidance of **Mr. V. D. Chougule** at Bharati Vidyapeeth's College of Engineering, Kolhapur.

## 🚀 Objectives

- Capture EEG signals representing user thoughts.
- Preprocess and classify the signals using CNN.
- Map classified signals to relevant visuals (e.g., digits or characters).
- Provide a simple and stable interface for real-time thought visualization.


## 🧩 Modules

1. **EEG Signal Acquisition** – Record brain activity via a DIY EEG headset.
2. **Signal Preprocessing** – Noise filtering, segmentation, normalization.
3. **CNN-based Classification** – Recognize patterns and classify thoughts.
4. **Image Mapping** – Link classified categories to pre-defined images.
5. **Visualization Output** – Display visuals representing user's cognitive state.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **NumPy, Pandas**
- **Matplotlib, OpenCV, Pillow**
- **MNE-Python** for EEG signal processing

## 💡 Key Features

- **No GANs required**: Avoids instability by using CNNs instead of generative models.
- **Assistive use**: Useful for non-verbal individuals to express themselves visually.
- **Low-cost setup**: Built using affordable EEG kits.


## 🧪 Results

- Achieved high accuracy in classifying thought-encoded EEG signals.
- Visuals reliably matched users’ intended cognitive categories.

> 📷 Example Output:
> - Thought: `3` → Output: 🖼️ [Image of digit 3]


## 🎯 Future Scope

- Real-time deployment and feedback loop
- Enhanced image generation quality
- Broader cognitive state classification (e.g., emotions, objects)
- Application in healthcare diagnostics
